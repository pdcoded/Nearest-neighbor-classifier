# Nearest-neighbor-classifier
Nearest Neighbourhood classifier to predict respective sports by athletes based upon age and weight.
The classifier KNN approach and the accuracy is 85% based on a small data set.
I would play around with more classifiers with beter ML tools and see the results.
One can also increase the training and test data and play around with accuracy.
